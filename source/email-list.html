    <p>Hey! Wes Bos here. </p>

    <p>I just launched a new, free 20 video course that will help you master CSS Flexbox! It's called <a href="http://flexbox.io/#/auth/[Email]">What The Flexbox?!</a>. Since you have received some training from me in the past I thought I'd let you know about this new course!</p>

    <p>This set of videos is 100% free. I've put over 60 hours into creating these and it would <em>absolutely mean the world to me</em> if you could share them with a friend <a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=What The Flexbox?! â€” a free 20 video course to help you master Flexbox by @wesbos http://flexbox.io">on Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://flexbox.io">Facebook</a> and be sure <a href="http://twitter.com/wesbos">follow @wesbos</a> or like <a href="http://facebook.com/wesbos.developer">on facebook</a> for more like this in the future! </p>
    
    <p>Here are your unique links to watch the videos and download the exercises. No need to sign up again. Apologies if you received this twice - the video series became super popular when I launched it yesterday and I had some email woes!</p>
